Hello.  
I found something interesting on LINE@.  
LINE gives us some regulations in normal LINE accounts to prevent abuse.  
But LINE@ has few regulations.

## What is LINE@
LINE@ is a LINE account for businesses.  
__LINE@ has been changed to "LINE Official Account" in April 2019.__  


## Auto Registration
Today, I tried to register LINE@ accounts automatically and it worked.    
I published [tutorial](https://github.com/k0tayan/LINEAtAuto).  
~~Make your LINE@ great.~~  
LINE@ is already closed.
