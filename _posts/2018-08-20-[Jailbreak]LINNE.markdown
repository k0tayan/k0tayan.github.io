Hello. Today, I made Jailbreak Tweak named LINNE(りんね). There is no special meanings.  
It has the following features.

- [Force Display Link Invitation Menu](/line/jailbreak/2018/08/16/LINE-ForceDisplay.html)  
It is useful for Japanese LINE Users. You don't have to logout to use link invitation.   
All you need to install this tweak to get link invitation menu.   
However the menu is displayed forcibly so the search bar is hidden.   
**You need to long press the menu to show the search bar**

- DisableUnsendMessage  
LINE has been added unsendMessage in update. This allows you to cancel message sending. However, I am very concerned about the canceled messages. DisableUnsendMessage block unsendMessage and permanently keep the message on your iOS Device.

- GetCMSToken  
Get the cmstoken for LINE@. You can see it from iOS Console.
