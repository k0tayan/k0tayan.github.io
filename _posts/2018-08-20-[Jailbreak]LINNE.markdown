Hello. Today, I made Jailbreak Tweak named LINNE(りんね). There is no special meanings.But LINNE is a girl around 17 years old. She is still Beta version. And she is Beta version forever.  
By the way, she has useful features.

- ![Force Display Link Invitation Menu](https://twitter.com/kotayan_0415/status/1020656364857638912)    
It is useful for Japanese LINE Users. You don't have to logout to use link invitation. All you need to install this tweak to get link invitation menu. However the menu is displayed forcibly so the search bar is hidden. **You need to long press the menu to show the search bar**

- ![DisableUnsendMessage](https://twitter.com/kotayan_0415/status/1031128066448187392)  
LINE has been added unsendMessage in update. This allows you to cancel message sending. However, I am very concerned about the canceled messages. DisableUnsendMessage block unsendMessage and permanently keep the message on your iOS Device.

- GetCMSToken
Get the cmstoken for LineAt. You can see it from iOS Console.
